*Hello…? Is anybody here?*
Hello everyone, my name’s tomatoanus, 
also known as the meager meatstick,  
this is a segmented speedrun 
of Resident Evil 2 Remake,  
and I’m gonna explain how the world record 
holder, Frit, beats the game in 51 minutes.
Frit didn’t just record the run for this video, 
he and the world record holder for Resident Evil 3  
Remake, Katastrophic, both helped with the script 
to make sure it’s all as accurate as possible
*Wilhelm scr-*
This is specifically a New Game 
Leon A Standard run at 120 FPS,  
the most popular category 
for the game on speedrun.com.
No New Game + or anything, and I’ll get into 
why the framerate’s important a bit later on.
Come on…
The game is essentially a string 
of getting key items required  
for progression through four main 
areas: RPD1, RPD2, Sewers, and Labs.
When Frit starts in a moment, he’ll skip the two 
intro cutscenes and shift boost to get moving.
If you hold ‘Shift’ before pressing a 
movement key like ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘S’, or ‘D’,  
Leon will stumble forward, 
which isn’t too optimal.
If you instead start holding ‘Shift’ 
after you start holding a movement key,  
Leon reaches max speed 
instantly instead of stumbling,  
saving up to 0.15 seconds each time 
you do it with optimal execution.
It’s a bit tough for the untrained eye 
to see a difference, but Frit does it  
to start the run here and arrive at the gas 
station door 0.15 seconds ahead of schedule,  
where he’ll shift boost again 
after skipping another cutscene.
After running past this guy taking his one 15 
minute work break to care for his neck wound,  
Frit heads towards the back of the station 
where he’ll skip another cutscene and run  
to the right past a zombie to go grab 
the key he needs to leave the station.
He shoots the zombie back here 
to be able to run past him,  
with this guy being super erratic and 
having a lot of variation in his behavior  
like stumbling which makes you miss your 
shot, or he can just grab you instantly.
On his way out of the station, notice 
how Frit turns two corners at the end  
of the aisle here really quickly, 
I’ll get to what that is soon.
After then saying ahoy to Claire, he skips 
a few cutscenes, including the title card,  
bringing him to Raccoon City proper.
Wow, it sure was nice for Pastony “Tony” 
Marinara to invite us to his new restaurant,  
don’tcha know. How about we 
give him a thank you gift.
Ooh, I think I’ve got something in my 
pocket that would make a great gift. Here,  
can you hold my wallet for 
a second while I find it?
You betcha. Say, this seems new, 
where’d you get this wallet Chicago Guy?
Oh, that’s a Wallet Pro by Ekster. It holds up  
to 14 cards, and if you press that 
ergonomic button it pops them out.
Ah! Ope, sorry, startled me.
Wow, I like the slimness of this 
while also having the cards easily  
accessible. I also appreciate the cash 
strap and the fact that the flap closes  
easily and stays compact. And 
hey, is this vachetta leather?
Yeah! Man, you always impress me with 
your ability to identify leather.
How fucking deep are your pockets, man?
And notice the Finder Card too, it’s compatible 
with the Apple Find My app so I can find my  
wallet if I leave it behind, and I can 
trigger it to ring from 300 feet away.
Dinner was terrific Tony, great job.
Thanks! Looks like the waiter filled your 
drink a little high there Minnesota Guy,  
lemme take care of that for you.

Don’t worry, I’ll pay. Just put it on 
whatever cards you can find in here.
Thankfully Leon’s dressed for the weather,  
which is probably the first 
thing you have questions about.
Costume mods became allowed in 2023 
after it was disproved that your  
character model changing affected bite chances.
Currently weapon cosmetics 
are still prohibited though,  
but we don’t know what the future holds, 
maybe someday we’ll see those in runs too.
Pay attention to how Frit rhythmically taps aim 
when he goes down and up stairs through the run,  
this is something called “stair skating”,  
which repeatedly cancels Leon and Claire’s slow 
stair animation so you run at a normal pace.
The zombie in the street up here is pretty tricky  
to avoid but Frit is able to bait it 
left before sidestepping to the right.
It’s not the most beginner friendly trick,  
but turns out a lot of this 
run is very beginner friendly.
So pause the video, redownload the game, 
put this video on a second monitor,  
get caught up, and then just copy what 
Frit does beat-for-beat as he does it.
The RPD1 segment is well underway, 
with it ending when he finds all  
three medallions and puts them 
in the statue in the Main Hall.
The stair skating I talked about 
a moment ago is the first of two  
big pieces of movement tech, with 
the second being “quick turning”.
It’s essentially what it sounds 
like, a quick way to turn,  
and is done by letting go of the direction 
you’re holding, holding the movement key for  
the direction you want to turn, and 
tapping aim to turn that direction.
Stair skating and quick turning 
combine to be hugely important,  
with stair skating alone saving 
over a minute through the run.
After he skips the cutscene here where he 
gets the notebook from the cop who dies,  
Frit does the first pause buffer of the run.
There’s a zombie that bangs on the door to this 
room and bursts through after a certain point.
The zombie’s internal timer continues 
to run when you pause though, so Frit  
pauses and times out how long he’s paused 
by cycling through the menu five times,  
and when he unpauses the zombie 
bursts through the door immediately.
The Resident Evil community uses 
the in-game timer that shows up  
on the final screen as your run’s official 
time, and that timer pauses when you pause,  
so this pause buffer is a way to get 
better zombie behavior without losing time.
Pause buffering and its validity is a bit 
of a contentious topic in the Resident Evil  
speedrunning community, so Frit tries to only 
use it in certain hard-to-react-to circumstances.
After crop dusting the cluster 
of zombies in the hall,  
Frit arrives back to the Main Hall where 
we meet Kenneth Branagh’s cousin, Marvin.
Hercule Poirot’s cousin gives Leon a combat knife,  
but Frit isn’t going to be using that for 
a bit, instead he, oh, uh, whoops, I lied,  
he actually uses it to access this lever, 
but then he won’t be using it for a bit.
On the other side of this gate Frit will pick 
up some bullets from the bench he passes,  
which is something that really only 
he does, but I’ll explain in a moment.
First he has to get past a hanging zombie around 
the corner at the end of the hallway up here.
He’s gonna do a quick turn there 
because if you take too wide a turn,  
the zombie will fall and stagger 
you, losing half a second.
Right now he’s on his way to get the Spade 
Key, a key item required for progression.
When you pick up an item, it goes into your first  
available inventory slot from 
left to right, top to bottom.
The four slots on the left are quickest and 
easiest to access, so he grabbed those bullets  
to fill the fourth slot to make the Spade 
Key go into the first slot of the second row.
Inventory management and 
making sure your items are  
in optimal spots for access is huge for this run.
After confidently climbing through a window 
with exposed skin coming dangerously close to  
broken glass and dropping down and really feeling 
that barefoot landing on hard tile in his knees,  
Frit rounds a couple corners 
and heads towards some stairs.
At the top of the third flight of stairs is 
the first big roadblock and reset point in  
the early game, with a zombie waiting 
there with a few possible patterns.
In this run Frit ended up getting an easy one  
where the zombie stumbles around and he 
can just shoot it once to stagger it.
He doesn’t want to be too liberal with 
shooting zombies though, more on that later.
Now that it’s later, the reason he doesn’t 
want to shoot zombies too much is because  
this game utilizes a “difficulty 
adjustment” mechanic, DA for short.
When you do things like take 
damage, pick up or use an item,  
damage enemies and/or miss shots, and 
more, you either gain or lose DA points.
Every 1,000 points denotes a level, and right now, 
and for a good bit longer, Frit will be at DA 5.
In the early game, zombies 
always stagger with one headshot,  
but at higher DA ranks that won’t be the case.
The difficulty adjustment is very routed 
out to try and make sure you avoid DA 7  
by the end of the game, with DA 7 slowing 
you down and making enemies much scarier.
If you end up doing too much damage throughout the run though
or don’t take enough damage,  DA 7 is a very real possibility.
In the Library he gets an unskippable call 
from the best director nominee’s cousin,  
so he uses this time to 
trigger the floor collapse,  
Leon not missing a beat when it 
comes to sticking to the dialogue.
Frit stutter steps before getting moving again  
because if you move too fast the radio 
call continues on when it shouldn’t.
He also violently shakes his 
camera which for some reason  
manipulates the zombie woman ahead to walk away.
After using the Spade Key, he’s on his way 
to the first of three medallion puzzles.
You have to turn three dials 
to their correct position,  
with the solutions always being the same 
but the starting positions being random.
You naturally lose time if you get a 
starting position that requires extra turns,  
but here he got the best case scenario 
where he had to only turn each dial once,  
with each extra dial turn losing 0.2 seconds.
Someone named joydurn actually made a browser  
game to practice these medallion 
puzzles, link’s in the description.
So a helicopter is going to crash in the 
hallway after using the Spade Key again up here.
If you’re running straight down the 
hall when the helicopter crashes,  
you get staggered backwards, but 
if you step towards the right,  
Leon instead stumbles left towards 
the door, saving about half a second.
After skipping the cutscene of the helicopter 
crash comes the first piece of menuing where he  
moves his gun to make space for the bolt cutters 
he’s about to grab, and also discards the key  
from the gas station since you can discard key 
items once you’ve exhausted all possible uses.
The bolt cutters themselves 
will be used three times,  
with the first being after we can’t 
get a hold of the cousin of the first  
individual to be nominated in seven 
different Academy Award categories.
So remember when Frit did that pause 
buffer shortly after first entering  
RPD to get the zombie to burst in immediately?
If you’re even slightly slower than 
optimal `in exiting the room then,  
that zombie is likely to be in your 
way after using the bolt cutters here.
Frit’s now making his way to the East 
Office, where he’s going to be picking  
up the round valve handle and the 
fuse to fully fill his inventory.
After removing the chair blocking the 
outward opening door Lebowski-style,  
he’ll use the fuse on the fusebox, 
flicking his mouse right and down to  
interact with the item that’s far away 
in the menu as quickly as possible.
After waiting for the gate to rise, 
the beach goer lathered in baby oil  
makes his way across the Main Hall to the 
west wing that he ran through earlier.
With the bolt cutters, he can now unlock a 
chained door in the Operations Room in the  
far back corner, but to get there 
he has to get past some zombies.
That hanging zombie he quick turned 
past earlier is still, well, hanging,  
so he quick turns on a tight line to 
again pass by without triggering it.
There’s another zombie up here who’s totally 
random and standing in the middle of the doorway,  
so Frit pulls up the weapon wheel to use 
the central icon to line up a headshot,  
then does a “quick draw” to 
instantly shoot the zombie.
After rounding the corners ahead,  
he’ll enter the Operations Room and do 
the last bolt cutters usage in the game,  
so he can discard them right after to make room 
for the electronic gadget he’s going to pick up.
He skips on picking up a flashbang in this room 
that would be used in a difficult segment later,  
and unlocks the door to head 
back through the hallway that  
he precariously climbed the wall into earlier.
He’s going to quick turn his way up the 
stairs here again, running past a few  
zombies stuck in static animations, and will 
head into the Locker Room on the second floor.
There he’ll use the round valve handle to turn 
off the steam and access a new area of the map,  
leading directly into one of the biggest RNG 
checks of the run, and a huge reset point.
This is the first real encounter with a Licker,  
and the community named him Randy Orton since 
he really likes to hit you outta nowhere.
Randy Orton is highly aggressive and 
highly unpredictable, with no real way  
of staggering or dealing with him, you 
just gotta hope you don’t get RKO’d.
After picking up the 9-volt and combining it 
with the electronic gadget to make a detonator,  
he makes his way back down the hall 
to the unicorn medallion puzzle,  
looking back in Randy Orton’s 
direction the whole time.
Lickers get stage fright and won’t go 
turbo mode if you have the camera on them,  
so Frit makes Randy Orton re-live 
forgetting his lines at Raw after  
WrestleMania 29 to barely reach 
the unicorn puzzle room safely.
This puzzle ended up taking seven turns to solve, 
four longer than optimal, losing 0.8 seconds.
Frit reenacts my typical local 
library entrance by bursting in  
through the door and picking up 
a knife he finds on the ground,  
before juking around a zombie with a tough spawn 
and moving the bookshelves while he’s here.
You have to move the shelves 
thrice to cross a path later,  
but he needs the jack handle 
to move it the other two times.
After climbing up the ladder, Leon takes back 
out his gun and flashlight from lord knows  
where as Frit runs into the West Storage 
Room, making his way to the maiden puzzle.
He arms the C4 with the detonator to get to 
said puzzle, grabs a Hip Pouch to increase  
his inventory by two slots, and does a little 
trick where by entering the Library real quick,  
it prevents the shelf from 
falling and blocking that door.
He positions Leon right on the edge of the C4’s 
blast radius, 3/4 of the way across the pillar,  
and starts running as soon as the 
detonation happens, preventing a stagger.
After he solves the maiden puzzle with 
only four turns, one off of optimal and  
losing 0.2 seconds, he deals with the 
Licker in the room with a camera manip,  
looking up when running by to avoid 
getting licked by someone we hardly know.
Heading back into the Library, Frit 
is gonna head back down the ladder  
with there being a fan of his at the bottom, 
just itchin’ to catch a sniff of Leon’s toes.
Leon has i-frames as you get off the ladder,  
so Frit is free to walk past and give a zombie a 
butt massage while heading to exit the Library.
He has all three medallions now so he’s headed to 
the statue on the ground floor in the Main Hall,  
where Marvin, inspired by his cousin’s success, 
is doing Tim Roth’s part from Reservoir Dogs.
Frit stair skates his way down to the statue, 
where after placing all three medallions,  
the statue reveals a secret 
passage and RPD1 comes to an end.
RPD2 starts off with a bit of running downstairs,  
followed by the first boss 
of the game: William Birkin.
Quick recap, Claire and Leon arrived 
in Raccoon City after the town started  
serving t-Virus on tap, and got 
separated at the police station.
The Tim Roth fan led us to the passage under 
the statue, saying it leads out of the station,  
and now we just so happen to bump 
into a lead scientist of the t-Virus,  
Uncle Baby Billy Birkin, and he 
injects himself with the G-Virus.
This causes him to mutate, 
where we’ll fight him three  
different times at different stages 
in his evolution, starting with G1.
Before he gets to the G1 fight, Frit is going to  
pull up his graphics settings and 
turn the image quality down to 50%.
This is to make sure he stays at 120 
frames per second during the fight,  
because dropping even a tiny amount of frames can 
lose you enough knife damage to make a difference.
The fight begins after Leon throws 
out his back lifting the shelf,  
with Frit’s aim in the fight 
being to orient Leon so the  
knife is in G1’s hitbox for the most 
amount of ticks to maximize damage.
He adjusts the angle he’s facing based on how 
G1 is moving, and knife angles are a weird,  
intuitive thing to learn that are 
super important in boss fights.
Right after the fight, he brings back 
up his graphics settings and sets image  
quality back to 100%, because again, the 
in-game timer doesn’t tick while paused,  
and this game looks great, so 
let’s look at it look good.
After quick turning at the top of the ladder, he 
makes his way through the underground facility,  
which will eventually end with a ladder that will  
spit him out into the parking garage 
in the police department basement.
While he does all that running, Leon’s bare 
feet slapping against the cold diamond plating,  
let’s chat about this game as a speedrun.
If you’re wanting to try speedrunning for 
yourself but haven’t found a game to try yet,  
and also happen to like this 
game (which why wouldn’t you,  
it’s one of the best games ever made), 
it makes for a great first speedrun.
It’s generally beginner friendly since it has such  
a simple control scheme and the ways of 
avoiding enemies are typically simple.
It’s not all a cake walk though, the 
boss fights can be tricky for beginners,  
there’s a lot of intricacies to them, but if 
you make sure to practice your boss fights,  
you should be able to finish a 
run without too much of a hassle.
And don’t get it twisted, I’m not saying 
that this run is easy to get a good time in,  
running at the top level 
requires a lot of practice,  
skill, and execution, but the barrier 
for learning the run yourself is low.
So Frit’s now at the Garage, a 
PTSD trigger I didn’t know I had,  
and after skipping the cutscene at the 
kiosk of Ada showing up and saving Leon,  
he’ll head through the Jail since there’s 
a crank handle he needs to grab in back.
Essentially he’s trying to get to the basement 
stairs and get back upstairs, but to get to  
the basement stairs, he has to unlock the door to 
them, and to unlock that door, you have to get to  
the Generator Room, and to get to the Generator 
Room, you need the crank handle over here
After skipping a cutscene involving an 
investigative journalist who was arrested  
because he was investigating the police chief 
(keep a lookout for that headline in the news  
these days), he picks up the crank handle and 
turns around to run back through the Jail.
The Jail is the west wing of the basement, and the 
Generator Room and basement stairs are both in the  
east wing, so he’s gotta cross the Garage again, 
and while he does that, let’s talk about doors.
Doors in the RE Engine are 
in general pretty finicky.
They’re not too bad in this game, but 
are much worse in Resident Evil 3 Remake.
They’re pretty sticky and just 
don’t want to open if you don’t  
open them correctly (though I do 
think that’s how most doors work).
You’ll see Frit quick turn into doors throughout 
the run, including during this stretch,  
and a quick turn into a door is a bit 
different than a normal quick turn.
Instead of letting go of the 
movement key you’re holding,  
pressing a different movement key, 
and tapping aim, you just need to  
let go of the movement key you’re 
holding and press a different one.
No need to tap aim, quick turning like this will  
typically seamlessly open 
even the wonkiest of doors.
After running through the Kennel, he gets 
to use the crank handle for the first time,  
dramatically raising the gate to reveal… 
the three stairs to the Generator Room.
He’s going to quick turn into the 
door to make his dramatic entrance,  
and he’ll then pick up a boxed electronic part.
This is the first of two boxed parts that are 
required to open the journalist’s jail cell  
to get the parking pass keycard that opens 
the Garage exit to leave the RPD2 segment.
He just flipped the switches in the Generator 
Room to unlock the door to the basement stairs,  
so it’s time to backtrack through 
the east wing he’s in to get there,  
but he has to cross back through the Kennel first.
This brings Frit to what he believes is 
arguably the worst segment of the run: the dogs.
They’re horribly, horribly random.
The first ones in the Generator Room and this one 
in the hall are static and pretty much always do  
the same thing, but there’s a dog that busts 
out of a vent in the Kennel he has to avoid,  
which he does by running a specific 
line towards a pillar on the wall,  
adjusting the angle towards the door 
the instant he crosses the trench drain.
Consistent movement makes the dog miss every time.
Once he’s out of the Kennel, 
the real shitshow begins.
There’s not much in the way of strats 
to get through this part safely,  
you kinda just have to blow 
through it and hope for the best.
You can shoot the dogs to buy yourself a 
little time if you know you’re going to  
get bit, and each time you end up 
getting bit you lose 1.5 seconds.
Getting bit by a dog would have serious 
repercussions since Frit wants to take  
specifically one back bite of damage 
the entire run to manipulate his DA,  
and a dog bite would throw it off to a point where 
you can’t get back to where you want it to be.
So after proving Blade wrong that 
skating uphill can be easy and then  
doing two quick turns at the top, 
he makes his way into the Break  
Room to grab a fuse before turning back 
around and continuing down the hallway.
There are two zombies vibing out 
at the fuse use spot down the hall  
where you also need to wait for the gate to raise.
It’s a bit hard to just hang out 
next to them while waiting though,  
and there’s a strat you can do where you 
shoot the wall or floor to manip the zombies,  
but Frit found it inconsistent and instead 
plays whatever random hand is dealt to him.
The first zombie is consistent and never lands 
his grab, but the second one has two patterns,  
with him doing the one in this run where 
you can run by and headshot him afterwards,  
which is better than the alternative of 
having to dodge him to avoid the initial grab.
After running past the bifurcated zombie, he heads 
outside and up the fire escape to the second floor  
where he’ll quick turn into the door and run 
down the hall to use the crank handle again.
As he runs down the hall and after 
quick turning ‘round the corner up here,  
he’s going to pass by the door to the Art Room, 
which he drives-by opens for shits and giggles.
No real point in me calling that out I guess.
He then can crank open this next gate, which 
has another dramatic reveal, this time of…
A hallway.
This one leads to a stairwell connecting 
to the first and third floors,  
and Frit stair skates up to head to 
the East Storage Room where he’ll  
grab the Large Gear before doing 
an Xbox 360 to turn and walk away.
The Large Gear is for the Clock Tower, 
which he’ll be heading to soon since the  
Clock Tower holds the second boxed electronic 
part required to get the keycard to leave RPD.
After skipping a cutscene and stair skating 
down into the Backyard up here, he’ll approach a  
tricky room where there’s two zombies inside that 
won’t open the door until you get close enough.
You have to interact with the valve outside at 
some point, so Frit does it now while he’s here,  
and tries to time interacting with the 
valve for the instant the door bursts open.
This delays things enough to where you 
can run past the first zombie that lunges,  
with the second one being unable to lunge for a 
moment since another zombie is already lunging.
After grabbing the Club Key, which is good for 
getting past bouncers and not paying covers,  
he does a really fast shot on the lady here  
which is the thing I mentioned 
earlier called a”quick draw”.
If you tap space to pull out a 
sub-weapon like a knife or grenade,  
Leon starts holstering his gun 
to pull out the sub-weapon,  
canceling the animation of him pulling 
up his gun if you aim and shoot in time.
There’s no delay, the bullet just comes 
out the instant you aim and shoot.
So after pulling the lever up here, 
the fire of the helicopter crash will  
be extinguished and our first encounter 
with Tyrant, aka Mr. X, will be set up.
Frit will use the wall in the hall as 
a visual cue to align himself to be a  
specific distance away from Mr. 
X after he moves the helicopter.
It’s after moving the chopper that 
X’s animation ends and he becomes  
active and will begin attacking, and if 
you’re a specific distance away from him,  
aiming at him, and not moving, X always does 
a lunging sweep attack you can blow past.
After blowing Mr.- , I mean blowing past Mr. X, 
there’s a chance we won’t see him again until  
we’re in the Sewers, but we’ll just have to see 
what the speedrun gods have in store for Frit.
So like I’ve mentioned, to exit RPD 
he needs to open the Garage gate,  
which requires the parking pass keycard, which 
he needs the second boxed electronic part to get.
That electronic part is located in the 
Clock Tower, but to get to the Clock Tower,  
you have to move all the shelves 
in the Library to make a bridge,  
and to move the shelves you need the jack 
handle, which is in the Records Room in the  
first floor of the west wing, which is where he’s 
headed now since the Club Key opens that door.
There’s now a Licker in the west wing halls 
leading to the Records Room, but by doing a quick  
turn to enter here and staring at the ceiling, the 
Licker is manipulated into jumping on the ceiling.
This is super advantageous and allows 
Frit to run straight up to and unlock  
the Record Room here, with the 
Licker zooming past behind him.
Inside he discards the crank handle 
since he’s fully used it and picks up  
the jack handle before exiting the room, 
having spent a short enough time in the  
room so that the zombie here is still 
getting up and stuck in an animation.
You typically don’t have to worry about the 
Licker when heading back towards the Main Hall,  
and I guess Frit must’ve upset the speedrun 
gods somehow because Mr. X ended up showing  
up again here, but he does the same manip, 
stopping moving and aiming at X until he  
does the lunging sweep attack, which 
Frit runs past, again blue balling X..
He’s currently beelining it to the 
Main Hall stairs to go up and access  
the Library on the second floor, where he’s 
going to fire a shot at the ground outside.
This manipulates a zombie that can spawn 
in a corridor in the Library so that it  
won’t grab you, but that zombie didn’t spawn 
there this run so the shot wasn’t necessary,  
but it’s always worth doing it just in case.
Using the jack handle to lower the 
shelf onto the track and moving the  
shelves twice to get them in place is 
a fairly big reset point that’s out of  
your control since sometimes there’ll 
be a zombie near enough to grab you.
This is more of an issue on the Hardcore 
difficulty with there being somewhere  
between a 10% and 25% chance of having to 
reset in this room when grinding for record,  
but when playing on Standard, 
you can tank a back grab here  
and be just fine as long as that’s the 
only back grab you take in the run.
While Frit works on getting the 
second boxed electronic part,  
let’s talk about another 
piece of tech: shot boosts.
Normally if you’re holding a movement key 
and ‘Shift’ and try to shoot your gun,  
Leon will do a stumble animation after 
shooting, but if you instead let go of  
‘Shift’ while aiming and before shooting, then 
hold it again after shooting and stopping aiming,  
there’s a seamless transition between 
running, shooting, and running again.
A shot boost saves a similar 
amount of time to a shift boost,  
about 0.15 seconds when done optimally.
While he retrieves the Small Gear from the 
upstairs of the Clock Tower and installs  
the gears to get the bell tolling and 
electronic part to fall and be accessible,  
it’s worth mentioning that certain 
terrain juts out more than it shows,  
and Leon will slow down when 
you approach things like walls.
There are two ways to avoid this slow down: by 
either tapping aim like with a stair skate, which  
interrupts your slow-down animation, or by 
momentarily letting go of your movement key  
and then holding it again, which stumbles Leon 
and is faster than the game slowing him down.
So with the second electronic 
part, he can pretty much leave RPD,  
he just has to make it all the 
way back downstairs, right?
First he has to get past a couple zombies here,  
with Frit pausing to check if the 
zombie outside the door is dangerous,  
and then giving us a top-down shot of the zombie 
cop trying to give him a shoulder massage.
The fastest way back to the basement 
is by unlocking the shortcut up here  
to the Storage Room, heading outside to the 
balcony to drop down to the second story,  
running through the Mr. X introductory 
hallway, down the fire escape,  
and past the bifurcated zombie to reach the 
stairs to the basement he unlocked earlier.
Speaking of the bifurcated zombie, the 
hallway after him is pretty variable:  
sometimes you don’t have to shoot a single 
zombie, sometimes you have to shoot every zombie.
Be on the lookout for quick draws combined with  
shot boosts there if he needs 
to tell a zombie to back off.
After heading back down to the basement, 
the RNG dogs become a factor again where  
getting bit isn’t only the table, it’s 
more on the table now than earlier.
There’s three dogs in the Garage proper, 
with one around the initial pillar who can  
bite you instantly that you can’t do anything 
about, just have to hope it doesn’t happen.
He takes a curved path here that 
generally prevents the dogs from  
biting you, but again, this sequence is random.
Frit glances back to maybe shoot a dog if 
one’s following and he knows it’ll bite him,  
but this time he got through unscathed.
He’s headed through the Jail to go back by 
the journalist who was illegally detained,  
since that’s where the panel is 
where you install the boxed parts  
to open the jail cells and grab 
the keycard for the Garage gate.
After solving a quick puzzle 
that he knows the answer to,  
he’ll grab the parking pass 
keycard off our fallen Italian  
brother before doubling back through the 
now powered up and unlocked jail block.
Remember after he used the bolt 
cutters for the last time how  
I mentioned he skipped grabbing a 
flashbang that could be used later?
That part is now because this prison sequence is 
an absolute mess and really tough to get through.
Frit has a lot to keep track of and 
execute properly to get through cleanly,  
and has a narrow window to pull it all off.
So the hallway looks like this, and 
here’s where all the enemies spawn.
He’s gotta get to the other side ideally 
without shooting and without taking any damage,  
and he’s going to do it using a strat 
discovered by a player named NixIssues.
Nix isn’t just a former world record holder 
for this category, but he’s also the only  
controller player in the top 15 on the 
leaderboard, and figured this all out,  
on controller, while routing a knife only 
category where he couldn’t use a flash.
The initial plan of attack is to run at an angle 
to bait the first zombie, then sidestep them.
While sidestepping, he’s also trying 
to bait a zombie in a cell on the  
left into trying to grab him once 
the first guy’s lunge is finished.
Since zombies have to wait a moment to lunge 
at you if there’s already one lunging at you,  
the baiting of the cell zombie is deliberate to  
give him a moment of safety 
while passing other zombies.
Hanging left and hugging the cell 
also helps with trying to make it  
past the two zombies out near the 
front, with the one on the left  
being super random and can step in front 
of you and block you or even grab you.
If things go well when you pass these two, the 
one on the right will turn and lunge at you,  
which cancels out the more random zombie’s lunge.
There’s two more zombies making 
their way down the hall though.
The one on the left is pretty 
static and easy to avoid,  
but the one on the right is also super random.
He can stumble out in front which you have no 
real chance of avoiding and will kill your run.
Frit will be trying to kinda cross the 
hall here to get to the right side and  
around these two zombies, which is right around 
when Mr. X will show up and complicate things.
The intention here is to have Mr. X get 
far enough into the room so that he does  
a punch before Frit gets intentionally 
grabbed by the guy who can stumble.
If you bait out the punch and grab correctly, 
X’s punch will connect with the zombie’s back,  
canceling out the grab and letting Frit blow by.
Part of the grab though is to shake 
your camera a ton when grabbed.
Runners used to aim at X here 
for a moment to bait the punch,  
but Katastrophic found this camera manip that 
baits a punch and saves 0.2 seconds over aiming.
This whole hallway strat is one that no one 
did for a while in main game runs because  
it was deemed inconsistent and runners 
found the huge randomness factor annoying.
Frit himself finds that this zombie here who can 
stumble really likes to give him a hard time,  
always stumbling when Frit’s doing an actual 
run and never stumbling while in practice.
Game day player for the t-Virus I guess.
Now, let’s see if Frit can execute on this all, 
or if he’ll have to think on his feet to get by.
Flawless.
When he enters the Garage, Frit skips a 
cutscene of the Kool-Aid Man showing up,  
and hey, Ada’s here now too!
It’s now time to leave RPD,  
officially wrapping up RPD2 and bringing 
us outside to make our way to the Sewers.
Little bit of catch-up on the story.
So essentially the Umbrella Corporation, 
which is a conglomerate with their  
hands in a bit of everything, including 
pharmaceuticals, is kinda corrupt and evil?
They made the t-Virus making all the 
zombies, the G-Virus Uncle Baby Billy  
Birkin infected himself with, and also Mr. 
X, who’s essentially a bioweapon seeking  
to uninstall everyone from the police 
department and hunt down the G-Virus.
Leon’s just trying to get out of here, 
while Ada reveals herself to be an FBI  
agent hunting down the G-Virus to 
use as evidence against Umbrella.
Her source on this was going to be our favorite 
Italian journalist, but Mr. X popped his lid,  
so she’s now decided to work with Leon 
to find their way to Umbrella’s secret  
underground facility, find a G-Virus sample, 
and expose what the company’s really up to.
Here the rain betrays Ada’s hair, revealing 
that she’s actually related to Bayonetta.
And I thought rain made my hair frizz out…
After skipping the dour cutscene where 
the gun shop owner tells his daughter  
to look at the flowers, we’re relocated to 
behind the shop where Frit will skate his  
way down a bunch of scaffolding 
to the entrance of the Sewers,  
all while FBI Agent Ada lore dumps a 
lot of the stuff I just talked about.
Frit’s already pretty up to snuff on all this 
exposition though, so he pulls ahead from Ada,  
sprinting towards the hole to the Sewers 
like it’s the Amagara Fault beckoning to him.
Ada’s realist attitude towards capitalism 
is interrupted by what appears to be an  
earthquake (wait a second, maybe 
this really is the Amagara Fault),  
but turns out that earthquake is actually 
a giant gator infected by the t-Virus.
Gonna be real, I got a lot of questions about just 
how long this gator was infected to grow so big…
Frit is so far ahead of Ada at this point 
that any of Leon’s voice lines just sound  
like he’s talking to himself, and this 
long running sequence is leading to a  
cinematic autoscroller where Leon’s 
gotta run away from the giant gator.
While a really dope and intense action beat, it’s 
very easy to get past the gator chase unscathed.
All you have to do is first hold ‘A’ to run to 
the far left and avoid the gator’s first attack,  
then hold ‘D’ to run far right 
and avoid the second attack,  
then hold ‘A’ once more to dodge the final attack.
Wait a second… ‘A’, ‘D’, ‘A’... that spells Ada.
*The X-Files theme*
After doin’ a Roy Scheider to the gator, Frit 
picks up a grenade that’s conveniently sitting  
on some trash and hasn’t fallen in the murky 
water yet to be lost forever, moves the ‘nade to  
the fourth inventory slot, and then moves his Club 
and Spade keys to out-of-the-way inventory slots.
He didn’t end up using them in all of their 
intended spots in the police department,  
so he’s unable to discard them and has 
to tote them along the rest of the run,  
and moving them now was actually a mistake,  
it’s more efficient to do it earlier when 
you have the large gear, but Frit forgot.
After FBI Agent Ada finally calls out and 
nearly crushes Leon’s skull with a ladder,  
it’s time to progress into the rest of the Sewers.
On the walkway here, Frit does his best Midwest  
impression by quick turning to say to 
Ada “ope, just gonna squeeze past ya”.
You still have to wait for Ada 
to walk to the elevator though,  
so getting past her doesn’t save any time.
It’s just a neat little thing 
you can do with speed tech.
This part’s a bit of an autoscroller 
where you have to ride the elevator down,  
so while that all goes on, I’d just like to say, 
as always, that I hope you’re all doing well.
If you’re not, then please remember, 
as always, that no feeling is final.
You are in no way defined by how you feel, 
and neither is the rest of your existence.
It might take a long time for things to get 
better, but they will, even if gradually.
You might not notice it day-to-day,  
but at some point you’ll think back 
and realize just how far you’ve come.
Just please always keep in mind that no 
feeling is final, and there is a tomorrow.
Back to the run, here Frit skips a 
cutscene where Dr. Annette Birkin shows  
up and pops a cap in Leon’s ass before 
fleeing, so we now get to play as Ada.
Ada has a unique weapon, the EMF Visualizer,  
which is used to hack electronic boxes and the 
big ass ventilation fans to turn them on/off.
Frit starts by scanning the panel to 
turn the fan at the top of the ladder on,  
then scans the fan so that it goes so fast 
that it busts almost as quickly as I do.
The EMF Visualizer has a pretty interesting 
trick that most people don’t know about.
Typically people will just hold 
down aim and fire to fill the  
hackometer (that’s what I’m calling 
the meter that fills when you hack).
Turns out though that if you tap fire when 
hacking, the hackometer fills up faster,  
though this does require some precise 
aiming and can be a bit tricky.
In the next room up here he’ll skate down some 
stairs, and when you’re halfway down them,  
there’s a zombie off to the right that will 
activate (which you can hear with his grunt).
If you have optimal movement and don’t 
stumble into any walls or anything,  
you can blow past the zombie for free, but 
a lot of beginners have trouble with this.
Thankfully there’s a safe path to the right 
here you can take which is just a touch slower,  
but Frit is able to zip on by, making this 
zombie look like he has zero peripheral vision.
To progress in the Sewers, he has 
to ride the lift out of this room,  
but he has to hack over here to 
power the lift fir- JESUS CHRIST.
Sorry, that zombie really got me.
After hacking, he makes his way back to the 
lift, and here he again uses the icon in  
center of the weapon wheel to line up a headshot 
before doing a shot boost to keep up his pace.
So when Frit’s tapping to fill the hackometer, he 
doesn’t actually need to fill it all the way up.
In fact, he can fill it so that he’s just one tap  
away from the point where 
it’s full, then run away.
It’s pretty easy to spot,  
so keep a lookout as he hacks throughout 
the rest of this FBI Agent Ada segment.
After hacking here and then pulling a lever while 
he can hear RobBat Battin’Bat’s boots approach  
behind him, he heads into the Ventilation 
Room where he gets another fan to bust,  
but Ada is impatient and leaps 
through while it’s exploding.
While Frit makes his way through the Incinerator 
Room, scoffing at a typewriter as he passes by,  
it’s worth mentioning that Claire and 
Ada have a mechanic that Leon doesn’t:  
if they’re in caution, you run 8% faster, 
otherwise they run the same speed as Leon.
Being in caution is a huge part of runs as Claire,  
since you try and spend basically 
your entire run in caution.
Frit just pulled the lever to open 
up the incinerator and now heads down  
into it to pick up the ID Wristband 
that opens up certain doors for you,  
with Dr. Annette Birkin locking Ada in the 
incinerator and turning me- her- it on.
So when you start Ada’s segment, you’re 
given a gun with nine rounds but your DA  
doesn’t go up at all when receiving them, 
so by unloading all of the ammo here,  
you lower your DA by about 80 
points, which is super valuable.
Here you have to power the boxes in a 
certain order while Ada’s ankles get singed,  
but powering them one at a time is slow, 
so he swaps back and forth between them.
This is pretty tricky, with competitive 
FPS experience being pretty valuable here,  
but it’s also super fun and 
satisfying when done well,  
and saves about two to two and a half seconds, 
which is huge when you’re going for record.
After re-enacting the end of Toy 
Story 3, the nearby door will be  
chivalrous and open for Ada thanks to her 
newfound wristband, and at the end of this  
hall we’ll enter the Treatment Pool 
Room where we’re on an upper walkway.
Frit will run onto the bridge in the center 
of the room, which starts a cutscene that  
ends Ada’s segment where Annette uses a 
machine to make Ada fall and hurt her leg.
This is why I hate technology, ‘cause in the 
end it’s just gonna push us all off a bridge.
After the cutscene, we transition back to playing  
as Leon, and are headed into the 
bulk of the Sewers segment now.
In order to leave the Sewers, we 
have to find three chess pieces:  
the rook, the queen, and the king.
The rook is the first one to get, but to get that, 
you first need to get the T-Bar Valve Handle,  
which he has to run for quite a while 
to get to, and in sewer water no less.
But again, thankfully Leon 
is dressed for the occasion.
Leaping into the water brought us to 
the second/middle floor of the Sewers,  
with Frit hanging a right at the fork in the road.
Up ahead he’s going to clamber out of the water, 
giving us a moment to check out Leon’s shoulder,  
with the costume mod having received 
a patch mid-run to give Leon vitiligo.
Anyway, up these stairs he’s going 
to run past a static bald zombie,  
but right after he has to pull the ol’ Abe 
Lincoln on a different zombie blocking the way.
After skating down these stairs, he grabs a knife 
off a barrel and hops back in the grimy water with  
zero hesitation or concern for letting his nuts 
adjust to the water’s temperature, and after  
sliding down the slide here, Leon gives in to 
his compulsive need to speak anything he tastes.
We’re now in the lowest level 
of Sewers for the first time,  
and up here we see a new enemy type: a G-Adult.
They’re quite annoying in general, 
but this first one’s not too bad.
If you shoot it from a certain distance away, 
it’ll pop out of the water and you can run past.
If you’re too close to it when you shoot though,  
the G-Adult can stagger you and grab 
you, which leads to getting poisoned,  
which loses a lot of time, like, anywhere from 15 
seconds to 45 seconds in the worst case scenario.
We’re currently making our way to the Monitor 
Room, which is sorta the main hub area of Sewers.
He’ll drop into there after climbing 
up here, and after dropping in he’ll  
skip a cutscene where Leon spots FBI 
Agent Ada in the adjacent Garbage Room,  
with something familiar snarling behind the 
unpowered Garbage Room door, desperate to get her.
After pulling the lever to lower the bridge 
to the other side of this Treatment Pool Room,  
he’s going to do a neat little piece of 
movement tech also found by Katastrophic.
If you run horizontally as 
the bridge is coming down,  
and tap ‘W’ into the bridge when it 
finishes, you hit max speed sooner.
After quick turning off the bridge,  
he’s going to do a baby stair skate down 
three steps to grab the T-Bar Valve Handle.
With the handle, Frit will be able to open the 
required doors to go get the rook chess piece.
After turning right around, he’ll 
go through a door up here and skate  
down some stairs to the “fake” central 
hub of Sewers, the Central Hub room.
Down there he’s going to pull a lever to open 
up a shortcut to the initial waterway we slid  
down to when Leon ate caca, and remember 21 
minutes and 54 seconds ago when I said “Frit  
wants to take specifically one back bite of 
damage the entire run to manipulate his DA”?
*Frit wants to take specifically one back bite 
of damage the entire run to manipulate his DA.*
Well this is where he’ll do it,  
letting one of these zombies get a 
taste of Leon’s vitiligo shoulder.
This is intended to be the only 
damage he takes the entire time.
Once he hops into the water and takes 
the shortcut, he takes a wide berth to  
the left to avoid the G-Adult that comes 
spewing out of the sewer on the wall.
He uses the T-Bar Valve Handle for the 
first time up here to raise a gate,  
and after riding the lift up inside, 
he’ll pick up another inventory pouch.
This is the last one he’ll grab in the run,  
bringing his inventory size from 10 slots 
to 12 slots, up from the original 8.
After unlocking the door here, he’ll grab the rook  
piece and turn right around 
to ride the lift back down.
At the bottom he’ll hop back into the Seine,  
and shoot the G-Adult that came spewing out 
of the wall, letting him run right past it.
So far the G-Adults have been pretty 
easy to avoid, but I promise you,  
they’ll be just about as problematic as 
your grandpa at Thanksgiving real soon.
Frit got some interesting RNG this run where he 
shoots the first zombie here, which is normal,  
but the guy being up on the ledge is really bad 
because he can instantly grab you and you can’t  
fight back, but thankfully in this run he just 
happened to be facing the wrong way to grab us.
He can be an annoyance coming up though, so 
keep him around in the back of your mind.
After using the T-Bar again, he’s now in the 
Bottom Waterway room, which is a big room that has  
a storage room on the other side of it, with the 
king and queen pieces being in that storage room.
There are a ton of G-Adults in this 
room, specifically on the other side of  
the little ledge he climbs over to enter 
the pool on the other side of the room.
I like to call that area “G-Adult City”.
The first one he has to get past is pretty simple,  
just shoot and run like normal, 
but the second is super tricky.
It’ll do a specific animation 
as it walks towards us,  
and you have to not only time 
your shot based on its movement,  
but also shoot it in a really precise spot 
to make it stagger and fall into the water.
If you miss the shot, then you have to bait 
him so you avoid an extremely annoying grab  
attack with a hitbox that makes no 
sense, but here he got obscenely lucky  
and was able to just run on by, which 
according to Frit should never happen.
Frit considers the G-Adults and the dogs to 
be the two most annoying enemies in the game:  
the dogs for their randomness and the 
G-Adults for their ridiculous hitboxes.
So the storage room here is a bit of 
a labyrinthine puzzle where you have  
to use the chess pieces to open 
and close doors to get through.
He starts by moving the queen to a 
plug that opens a door to some stairs,  
with the king being at the top.
He’ll drop down after grabbing it, and you can 
hear that we’re no longer alone in this room,  
though like me, the zombie is gonna struggle 
with the maze, so it won’t be of concern.
He moves the queen again, this time 
to unlock a door leading to both the  
exit and a king plug, which he puts the king in.
This opens a second door that connects the 
king and queen plug, letting him do a little  
loop to grab the queen and head through the 
king’s door to return to the king and exit.
With the monarchs stored somewhere on or in Leon’s 
body, he has to make his way across G-Adult City  
again, with the first G-Adult as you hop off the 
ledge being the big RNG and reset point in Sewers.
He does an interesting piece of tech 
when going down the ledge where you  
hold aim in the direction of the G-Adult, 
which manipulates it into the move where  
it spits babies at you, with it being 
harmless while it’s in that animation.
Here the G-Adult decided to do 
a big overhead swing though,  
which thankfully you can run past too.
After climbing onto and down the ledge up ahead 
to exit this pool and G-Adult City, there’s a  
rural G-Adult that comes at you fast that’s super 
tricky since in Leon runs you have to land three  
shots on its eye to stagger it, and in typical 
G-Adult fashion, the eye’s hitbox is super wonky.
Note to those of you still mimicking Frit, this 
is not a beginner friendly strat, instead you  
should go up on the ledge on the right, wait 
for a grab attack, then jump down and run past.
Now that he has the three chess pieces,  
he’s making his way back to the Monitor 
Room, which again is the real central hub.
Up here he has to make his way back 
through the phony Central Hub though,  
and remember that guy who was on 
the ledge but facing the wrong way?
Well because he was on the 
ledge earlier and lunged,  
that means he likely is on the stairs 
we have to run up on the right.
Frit is keeping track of this though, 
and is able to squeeze by on its left  
which is both very dangerous 
and also very cool looking.
So when he gets to the real central hub,  
he has to solve a puzzle with all the chess 
pieces, but the solution is always the same.
Simple as: plug in the queen, swap bishop for 
the king, take out the knight and do some cool  
menuing where you type ‘S’ ‘D’ ‘S’ ‘D’ to get to 
the rook, then plugging in the knight and bishop.
This unlocks the room next to us that contains  
the switchboard that opens the 
Garbage Room doors Ada’s behind.
Before we can rescue her though, we 
have our final chore of Sewers/the  
next boss fight against Uncle 
Baby Billy’s next evolution: G2.
This is a tricky fight that Frit advises 
all new runners really practice a lot,  
and is the one that he 
believes people die on most.
The next fight, G3, is actually easier 
than this one in terms of not dying.
The trigger to spawn G2 is basically running 
over to the door we enter this room through,  
and if you preemptively throw the 
grenade we picked up after the alligator,  
it hits G2 as he spawns in for extra damage.
It specifically is hitting G2’s hand 
as he pokes it through the ceiling,  
and deals about 6% of his max HP in damage, 
which skips the ceiling whack-a-mole sequence  
and makes him instantly come to 
the gate and save 15-20 seconds.
As soon as G2 breaks the gate down like 
he’s an eager Black Friday shopper,  
Frit runs past him since the real Black Friday 
deal is always in the shoppers’ unlocked cars.
While Frit runs to the battle arena, he again 
lowers his image quality since reminder,  
it keeps his frame rate high which 
helps maximize his knife damage.
He’ll then go and hit the button 
to move the storage container to  
the far left to prep for later, 
since to finish this fight you  
need to get G2’s health under 50%, 
then hit him with the container.
He then runs into the crate’s corner, 
which baits G2 into an attack,  
and Frit gets to work, really 
focusing on his angles to make  
sure that he gets G2 staggered and 
on the ground as fast as possible.
Normally runs are done with a speedrun tool 
that displays enemy health, player health,  
inventory, and your DA value, but he 
didn’t have it for the run in this  
video and had to use his intuition to 
sus out when G2 was below half health.
This might sound easy, but 
knife damage is a little random,  
and you won’t always get G2 there 
in the same number of slashes.
He lays in a few extra slashes for good 
measure but ended up actually doing a  
little too much damage here, meaning 
his DA is a bit higher than intended  
for the rest of the run, which is hugely 
important, since if your DA is too high,  
staggering zombies with headshots 
later on becomes a total coin flip.
Once he finishes slashing, he runs over 
to the button to begin the crate on its  
collision course, then needs to 
get G2 on that collision course,  
baiting him to the far side of the 
arena with a running slash attack.
He grabs some handgun ammo, a flash, and a knife 
while waiting for G2 to get Regina George’d,  
skips the cutscene of it happening, then 
begins making his way to rescue Ada.
He starts this short jaunt by running 
across this destroyed scaffolding that  
thankfully fell in such a way that 
not only connects to the other side,  
but is also structurally sound 
enough for Leon to cross.
After unlocking this shortcut 
door to the Garbage Room here,  
he again raises his image quality to 
100%, then skips the cutscene where  
Leon rescues Ada and rips out a sharp piece 
of debris that was lodged deep in her thigh.
Frit and the somehow-not-horribly-limping-Ada 
then begin making their way to the cable car,  
which is the exit to Sewers and entrance to Labs.
In the story, they’re still chasing down both 
a sample of the G-Virus and Dr. Annette Birkin,  
who fled to NEST, which is the official 
name of the Umbrella Corporation’s labs.
Right before they get in the cable car though,  
Frit is going to do the most important 
shift boost of the entire run.
It’ll be to get past Ada before she has 
a chance to block the car’s doorway,  
which if she does, loses you three seconds.
This brings us to the end of 
Sewers and the start of Labs,  
and when Frit sets off at the end of the 
cable car ride, FBI Agent Ada will stay  
put in the cable car because of her leg with 
us pretending we didn’t see her walk on it  
for a considerable distance in Sewers, but she 
is kind enough to give Leon the ID Wristband.
This final segment, Labs, is Frit’s favorite 
because of 1.) the nerves you have going into it,  
and 2.) it feels the most balanced 
in terms of everything going on.
There’s a few puzzles, there’s a little RNG 
but not too much, there’s plenty of tricky  
things that are satisfying to pull off, 
and he really enjoys the two boss fights.
Our main goal here is to 
secure a sample of the G-Virus.
He has a quick breather here while waiting for 
the door to open, so he wastes some bullets to  
both lower his DA a bit, but also expend bullets 
so he can reload and free up an inventory slot.
In the Reception room he immediately heads right 
down a visitors wing, where he’ll enter the  
cafeteria and find some starving zombies, licking 
their lips since lunch just walked in the door.
Too bad none of them are a threat, they’re 
all either out of the way or just AFK.
He climbs a ladder to pass through a ventilation 
tunnel to get past a locked door leading to  
the staff hallway, and when passing through the 
Kitchen he’ll nab a Combat Knife off the counter.
The wristband that Ada gave 
Leon was a no-frills wristband;  
it just unlocks visitors doors, we’ve 
gotta upgrade it to access more of Labs.
There are two upgrades for it, the first being 
back here on Thing from The Addams Family,  
and the second one is in the Greenhouse.
After combining the upgrade with the wristband, he 
has to quick draw shot boost this armored zombie  
who wandered in the way, with Frit giving him 
a nod of approval for not tanking the headshot.
If you’re at DA 6 like we want, they have 
a 10-20% chance of tanking a headshot,  
but if you’re at DA 7, then it’s closer to 50-70%.
With the General Staff Wristband, he can 
now extend the bridge in the Main Shaft,  
which is the central hub room of Labs.
There’s always a fair bit of running 
in this room, which gives us time to  
think about things like how dirty the 
bottoms of Leon’s feet probably are.
What added flavors were there when 
that zombie gave ‘em a sniff earlier?
He uses the console to extend 
the bridge to the east wing,  
which is where the Greenhouse 
and Senior Staff upgrade are.
In order to reach the upgrade,  
we have to make an herbicide that’ll 
kill a big ol’ plant blocking it.
The herbicide is first synthesized into a solution 
in the Drug Testing Lab, then later finalized  
through a cooling process in the Low-Temp Testing 
Lab, which is pretty much a walk-in freezer.
He needs a vessel for the solution though,  
not like vessel like when we do the culling when 
I stream, like, something to hold the solution.
He doesn’t have space for 
it in his inventory though,  
so while he waits for the door to open up 
here, he’s going to shoot one round to use  
up the last of an ammo stack and free 
up a slot for the herbicide cartridge.
After passing this Ivy Zombie 
that’s still waking up,  
he inputs some security codes that 
are always the same in this scenario.
Unfortunately you can’t use the number 
pad for this, you have to use ‘WASD’ to  
navigate, and then press the interact 
button, which Frit has bound to ‘E’.
This is an easy to remember keybind,  
since you’ll always remember that 
Frit starts with the letter E.
These codes unlock the ladder 
in the Greenhouse and the door  
to the Drug Testing Lab, where the 
herbicide solution synthesizer is.
After picking up his cart from 
the dispo, he shift boosts to  
save another 0.15 seconds and bursts on into 
the Greenhouse, headed to the unlocked lab.
The synthesis is a puzzle, where the answer 
is red green blue, red green blue, red green.
Way easier than I remember from trying to 
solve it in my playthrough, that shit was hard.
Once you solve it, you have 
to wait for it to empty,  
with it draining slower than 
an octogenarian’s bladder.
He’s now looking to go to the 
freezer to herbicide-up this bad boy,  
and the freezer is down the ladder 
he just unlocked in the Greenhouse.
The Ivy Zombies in the Greenhouse 
are now a threat though.
You can get by them if you stagger them 
with a shot to one of their pustules,  
but they’re super dangerous.
Like, they always one shot you when they 
grab you if you don't use a defensive item.
Super scary stuff.
He’s now entering the Lounge which 
has some Lickers that spawn in it.
He looks at the ceiling to manipulate the 
one that spawns here to avoid weird attacks,  
and it’s an easy run on by, though the 
Lounge won’t be so simple for very long.
So the freezer door needs power to be 
opened, which seems like a design flaw.
What if someone’s in there 
when the power goes out?
Is Tesla making freezers now?
Anyway, to turn on the power,  
he needs to grab the Signal Modulator 
that’s at the top of this stairwell.
After grabbing the modulator, he 
has to run back down to the Lounge,  
where Frit’ll do a super toxic strat 
that no one has submitted a run with yet.
He picked up that flash in the G2 arena for this.
In the Lounge there will be 
two Lickers and three zombies,  
with the Lickers always being off to the 
left and the zombie spawns being random.
He has to get past them to 
interact with the power panel,  
and he’ll start by firing a shot at the ground 
to make the Lickers jump to the ceiling.
He’ll then toss the flash to hit all the enemies,  
with Lickers having their flash duration 
extend since they were on the ceiling.
Again though, the zombies are totally 
random and can spawn pretty close,  
so this strat can be pretty tough.
When he places the modulator on the wall,  
he tunes it to the same frequency 
Matthew McConaughey did in Interstellar.
Going back across the Lounge is super treacherous 
though, with Frit slowing himself slightly to  
prevent a Licker from slashing, though this 
run he got super lucky with the farther  
Licker bumping into the closer one, causing the 
closer one to turn around and ask what he wants,  
and Frit also pops a shot at a zombie, 
leaving it thinking “the fuck did I do?”
This is potentially a placebo thing, 
but Frit and Katastrophic have been  
workshopping it and they think it 
manipulates the zombies to be in a  
better position when you cross 
back through this room later.
The freezer is a pretty straight forward part with  
Frit just having to run in and interact with 
the cooler thingy to finalize the herbicide.
Now blessed with nipples that could slice 
tungsten, he begins making his way back  
across the Lounge, with him wanting to 
go back to the ladder and Greenhouse.
That means he has to hang a left at that 
corner where all the Lickers and zombies  
were hanging out, and gonna be real, 
this part is just incredibly chaotic.
He shoots that guy from the placebo shot, 
who was just wandering up to ask why he  
got shot earlier, and just runs past 
as Lickers fly all over the place,  
and keeps his camera pointed back to prevent 
the Lickers from getting the zoomies.
He fires off a round right before climbing 
the ladder, which manipulates the Ivy Zombies  
upstairs into better positions, which 
is another strat found by Katastrophic.
The Ivies here are a notable reset point for Labs,  
and can be really high stress ince it’s easy 
to let the nerves get to you and miss shots.
In this run the manip worked perfectly 
and he didn’t encounter a single Ivy  
while making his way to use the herbicide 
at the spot he first grabbed the cartridge.
This sends the herbicide through the 
sprinkler system, dousing every Ivy  
and also the big ol’ plant, causing the 
scientist who was pinned to the wall by  
the big ol’ plant to fall, allowing us to 
snag the Senior Staff wristband upgrade.
As soon as he grabs it, he’ll combine it with 
his wristband, and also start making his way  
back the way he came, planning to now leave 
the east wing and head back to the Main Shaft.
First though he has two more Ivies to 
get past in the overgrown room up here.
This room is just notoriously bad,  
since you can get body-blocked by the Ivy in 
your path that you have to shoot and stagger,  
and getting body-blocked gives the 
second Ivy the window to grab you.
Countless runs have died from getting 
body-blocked despite staggering the  
Ivy correctly, and at one point Frit quit running 
the game for a bit because of a run he lost here.
Here though the Ivy politely stepped out of the 
way when staggered, clearing the path for him.
While Frit makes his way to the west wing, 
hoping to maybe see Josh Lyman while he’s there,  
I’d like to give a big thank you to everyone 
who made this video possible: my Patrons.
For as little as $3 a month, you help fund 
the channel and help with costs like paying  
runners for their time and expertise, 
and you also get access to videos early,  
your name in these credits, and the ability to 
suggest and vote on future runs to be covered.
If you support at a higher tier, like $6 a month,  
you also get access to my Retrospective 
series as it releases, as opposed to a  
year later on my other channel, and you 
also get access to a monthly live Q&A.
Supporting the channel monetarily 
is entirely unnecessary,  
yet you all choose to do it 
anyway, so thank you, truly.
It’s time to do some final 
prep before the G3 fight.
First, Frit picks up a grenade 
off the ground up here,  
then manually equips a knife with full durability.
The one he’s swapping off of is pretty 
beat up and would break quickly,  
which would mean extra menuing in the fight.
After using the Signal Modulator, this wing is 
now powered up, and he can make his way to the  
far end to grab the G-Virus sample, with Leon 
getting a surprise Windex spritz along the way.
So literally a moment ago I talked 
about how Frit swapped off the beat  
up knife so he doesn’t have to 
menu as much in the G3 fight,  
but working on this video led Katastrophic 
to realize it would actually be best to wait  
on swapping knives until you get a slash 
or two in with the beat up knife on G3.
This squeezes a little extra juice 
out of the knife and makes it a lot  
easier to have a healthy enough knife 
for the final boss fight after G3.
So with the virus sample in hand, the 
G3 fight will start as we’re going back  
across the bridge, with us dropping 
down into the bioreactor area below.
He’ll start the fight by throwing a grenade 
into this specific little green zone.
He needs it to land there because if it’s short 
of it then Leon can stagger and the fight will  
get messed up completely, or it can pop one of 
G3’s eyes, but we need those intact to stagger  
him at specific points, and if you throw 
too far, the ‘nade won’t deal enough damage.
He’ll then dig in with the knife, trying to pop 
the thigh eye in two to three slashes to stagger  
him, with Frit sneaking in a few extra slashes 
before backing off to bait a ground slam attack.
This gives a window to pop the 
shoulder eye followed by the back eye,  
with the angle for the back being really precise.
G3 will then go into a phase where his chest 
eyes are exposed and he chills on the floor,  
and Frit will focus on knifing the back, 
standing a little away from G3 since if the  
knife hitbox pokes through G3 and damages one 
of his chest eyes, he’ll instantly stand up.
He’s constantly watching his knife durability and  
swapping to new knives the instant 
his current one approaches zero.
He drags his camera opposite the knife’s 
slash direction to slightly increase the  
time the knife is in G3 and get an extra 
percent or so of damage with each slash,  
drastically cutting down on the fight’s 
length, with the big goal being to beat G3  
before he has a chance to grab the wall, 
because then you’ll lose 10-15 seconds.
After riding the lift up, he skips a cutscene 
where Dr. Annette Birkin reveals that “FBI Agent”  
Ada’s real name is actually “Sell the G-Virus to 
the Highest Bidder Because I’m a Mercenary” Ada,  
and warns Leon about the virus 
getting into the wrong hands.
It’s time to run back to the shaft, with Leon 
again getting surprised by the Windex spritz.
A 10-minute self-destruct sequence is now 
beginning because Leon stole the virus,  
and upon his arrival to the shaft, he skips a 
cutscene where Ada has mustered up the strength  
to walk again, uses her visualizer to get the 
central elevator working, gets shot by Annette,  
and falls a billion feet down the 
shaft alongside the virus sample.
We don’t have time to process 
our conflicted emotions though,  
it’s time to hop on that elevator 
and go to the final sequence.
Time for our final moments of reflection, 
taking in the serenity of the silence.
A chance to steel ourselves, collect our thoughts 
before the culmination of all our trials.
Isn’t it weird how when Frit 
strikes a pose with the knife,  
we just get the most awkward 
perspective of Leon’s left bicep?
Looking a bit like Quagmire these days...
After some RE2 shower thoughts, he runs 
up and triggers a cutscene where we get a  
FaceTime from Claire but the signal is 
real bad so we just skip the cutscene.
For those of you still right on Frit’s heels in 
your own speedrun, there’s a knife on the right  
after this cutscene, which is super useful if you 
don’t have a knife with at least 250 durability.
You need a knife at least that strong 
to be able to take on Mr. X, er- rather,  
Super Tyrant, which is what Mr. X mutates into.
As he rides this lift enroute to the fight,  
he takes two super precise shots to manipulate 
some Ivies in this area so that he can run past.
Before this manip was found,  
this segment was absolutely killer 
and caused runners a bunch of grief.
At the bottom of the ladder up ahead, Mr. X is 
gonna pop up again, and you have two options:  
you can do the same dodge as earlier where 
you aim at him from a certain distance,  
then run on by, or you can do the 
tricky one that saves a second,  
where you run up to his knee, aim off 
to the left, and wait for him to punch.
If you run too early, he’ll toss ya, 
so you’ve gotta wait until a certain  
part of the animation, and then 
essentially duck under the punch.
Super scary, but fun to execute.
As he runs through the burning hall up here,  
he’ll skip a cutscene where Mr. X grabs 
him, but several explosions distract X.
He’ll then run to the final encounter, grabbing 
the Joint Plug off the table on the other side  
of this door, and going straight to the 
giant lift to use it and trigger the fight.
The explosions essentially 
mutated Mr. X into Super Tyrant,  
and he’s now cosplaying as Iris from Companion.
This fight is a little bit of an autoscroller, 
normally you have to wait about two minutes  
and ten seconds for Deus Ex Rocket Launcher 
to slide down the shaft, but Frit staggers  
Super Tyrant three times to start the fight 
since the timer gets lowered by 20 seconds  
the first three times you stagger him, bringing 
the total wait to 70 seconds instead of 130.
The rest of the fight is then camping X’s 
weak arm like hiding behind your opponent  
in Snowball Summit, waiting for Ada 
to throw Leon that rocket launcher.
There’s still a bit more tech, but before the 
run’s over and while he’s waltzing with X,  
I wanted to thank you for watching this video 
on behalf of Frit, Katastrophic, and myself.
I’d also like to give a huge thank you to 
Frit for helping make this video possible  
by recording this run and walking me 
through all of it, and also a big thank  
you to Frit and Kat for helping make sure 
everything was right all along the way.
They’re both very talented runners,  
please do be sure to check out their 
channels, links are in the description.
While Frit dances around, he makes sure to 
keep Super Tyrant clear from the debris that  
fell into the arena, because if any of Super 
Tyrant’s attacks end up hitting the rocks,  
the AoE is huge, so you have 
to be quite aware of that.
So, a year and a half ago, alongside 
quick draw being discovered, it was  
found that if you tap Space to bring out a 
sub-weapon before you pick up the rocket,  
and hold both mouse buttons and ‘W’ when you 
pick it up, the rocket will instantly fire.
Don’t have to aim it or anything, it comes out 
immediately and turns Super Tyrant into just legs.
This was found by curtiz, a former 
Claire world record holder, and this  
was a huge discovery because before this, 
Super Tyrant was incredibly inconsistent.
Frit’s now pretty much home free, all he has to 
do is a modified version of a quick draw where  
to get it to work with the rockets, he pulls 
out his handgun and does a quick draw with it,  
swapping to the rocket in the 
middle of when he taps Space.
This nukes a cluster of zombies 
blocking the end of the game.
He can then just run on ahead 
to the train and hop on,  
time officially ending as soon 
as the train cutscene starts.
That about wraps it up for this video.
This was a segmented Leon A Standard 
speedrun of Resident Evil 2 Remake,  
I’ve been tomatoanus, and I hope 
you have an above average day.
